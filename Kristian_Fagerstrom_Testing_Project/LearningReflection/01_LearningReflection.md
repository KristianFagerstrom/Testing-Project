## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
It helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice.The project provides an opportunity to apply knowledge gained from textbooks and classroom lecture in a practical setting, where we can experience the challenges that arise in solving real-world problems. This experience gives us a better understanding of how theoretical concepts work in practice and identifies any gaps in our understanding that can be addressed through further teaching.

In addition, working on projects also helps develop critical thinking, problem solving and entrepreneurial skills, which are essential in any professional environment. It allows us to experience and learn from mistakes and develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for the work we do.

In conclusion, projects are an effective way to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. They provide valuable learning experiences and help develop the skills necessary for success in any career.
Not anything else.
